	<div class='hideme'>

			I wrote my University of Chicago admissions essay about the worldline of an opportunity that originated when my Great Grandpa Benjamin immigrated to America and purchased his first piece of real estate in Queens. A worldline is a path in spacetime, tracing the history of an object’s location in space at each instant in time. The worldline of the opportunity associated with 4541 39th Place, Queens, NY, combines elements of space and time into one overarching 4D tale of my maternal family’s history and achievement of opportunity. 
		</p>

		<p>
			As I brainstormed ideas for my Un-Essay, I found myself gravitating towards this story and, particularly, the way it combined elements of space and time. Something about it was distinctly Jewish. Perhaps it was merely the fact that it centered around my Great-Grandpa, whose life was so defined by his Jewish identity. He fled Russia due to pogroms; achieved the quintessential American dream in the 1930s alongside a wave of Jewish immigrants; was an avid Zionist, supporting hospitals, kibbutzim, and synagogues in early Israel; and passed away after being hit by a Manischevitz truck while on a run one morning in Brooklyn (remove this?).
	    </p>
	</div>

	<div class='hideme'>

	    <p>
			More accurately, this story is "Jewish" because it captures the intense, incredibly meaningful coalescence of space and time in the Jewish experience - something I have felt almost every day in this class. So many of the pieces we explored throughout the quarter felt relatable, despite their originating from disparate cultures, time periods, and authors. I found myself reading and rereading Marge Piercy's description of courage and ancestry in "Maggid," flashing back to an elementary school visit to the local Holocaust museum while discussing Etgar Keret's <i> Shoes</i>, and running along the lake shore to A-WA’s empowering songs. These connections between pieces created in diverse continents as early as the 1400s, then discussed over a Zoom call in 2021, and reminding me of a great grandfather who lived in 1800's Russia, all blur space and time. As we progressed through Jewish history in this class, I progressed through my own family’s history across space and time. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This process of hopping back and forth between continents and centuries - like my Grandpa Benjamin’s story and the Jewish history that we have spent the quarter exploring - is full of both joy and pain. It is diverse and rich. It contains uncanny parallels between past, present, and future. In this interactive timeline, I hope to capture this spirit. In each entry, I integrate a topic or a piece from class with an instance in space and time of my family’s history.

        <br>
        The cleverness of my great grandpa Ben - which you can practically see in his smile and the sparkle in his eyes in this picture - reminded me of <i> Tevye the Dairyman </i>. I picture both stories taking place in the forests and winding paths of Eastern Europe/Western Russia, and featuring quips in Yiddish and humor and hidden acts of defieance in the face of anti-Semitism.

In 1964 Grandpa Harvey moved to New York for his fellowship in hematology/oncology at Sloane Kettering. When he first arrived from Canada, he was staying with his cousins, and when he arrived to their house and knocked on the door, my grandma opened it. She was completing her PhD in microbiology at City College of New York at the time. The rest was history.

        My grandma grew up in Brooklyn, and my grandpa in Windsor, Ontario. His family emigrated from Antipol, fleeing the anti-Semitic violence to which they later lost many relatives - but encountered virulent anti-Semitism in Canada. His father, a peddler who sold on time, would often be thrown out of houses and denied payment when he came to collect, simply for being Jewish. When Grandpa Harvey was seeking work, he was denied at multiple Toronto hospitals due to pervasive Jewish quotas. His defiance - implicit in his success and constant work ethic - and the theme of encountering discrimination even in a new, supposedly more welcoming home, is echoed in A-WA's "Hana Mash Hu Al Yaman."

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">1990 Kibbutz Yifat, Israel</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">A memorial video for my Grandma's cousin, Chagai, filmed at Kibbutz Yifat. Chagai was a distinguished pilot in the IDF. He passed away in a crash during a training exercise. Kibbutz Yifat was founded by my ancestors who fled from Antipol prior to the Holocaust. When I watch this video, I am struck by the beauty and serenity of the kibbutz, as well as the sheer number of Jewish family members and friends depicted. I've never been to Israel - never seen such a large, naturally-occurring Jewish community. The video truly represents the achievement of the longings of Zionism - and the somber cause for its creation is a reminder of the sacrifices and pain that are often in tension with happiness and success in the Jewish experience. </p>

        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
          My Grandma and Aunt visited Antipol to return to the origins of our family's history and the site of horrific events that have had ripple effects on my family. The mass grave where our family members were buried is now covered in verdant grass. The Jewish cemetery where the first victims of anti-Semitic violence were buried was ransacked during the final liquidation of Antipol's Jews.

        <h2 class="timeline__content-title">2018 Queens, NY</h2>
        <p class="timeline__content-desc">
        	While in New York in 2018, I visited the first building Grandpa Benjamin had bought in America. While outside the building with my Dad, a man walked out, and we began to chat. His name was Carlos Suarez, and his brother was the building Super. Arnold Marcus (Benjamin Marcus's son) opened the doors to Carlos and his family when they first moved to America from the Dominican Republic in the 1990's. They've had a close relationship with the Marcus family ever since. He spent half of his adult life in 4541 39th Place, Queens, NY, where his dad was once the building superintendent, and he recently returned to live. The original elevator - picked out by Great Grandpa Benjamin - remains in use. As I ascended to the top floor in it, Mr. Suarez alongside me, past, present, and future seemed to coalesce. Though I'd never before been in the building, I felt at home.
